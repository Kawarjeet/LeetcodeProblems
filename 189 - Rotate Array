Given an array, rotate the array to the right by 'k' steps, where 'k' is non-negative.

SOLUTION:
# We will try to solve this problem using three different approaches.

# 1) Rotating the array in-place with O(1) space. In this approach, we will try to reverse the array, a total of 3 times, which then produces the desired output. In first reversal
# the entire array is reversed. In second reversal we reverse the first 'k' elements, and in third reversal we reverse the remaining elements in the array. 
# For example, 
# nums=[1,2,3,4]     k=2
# desired output: nums=[3,4,1,2]
# after first reversal of all elements in array: nums=[4,3,2,1]
# after second reversal of first 'k' elements: nums=[3,4,2,1]
# after third reversal of remaining elements: nums:[3,4,1,2]
